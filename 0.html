        <p>Because responsive web design is hard, this website is best experienced on a computer instead of a phone.</p>
        <p>Also, if you can, it would be best to maximize the browser window.</p>
        <p>Oh and if you're wondering what browser would work best I would say probably Chrome or Firefox.</p>
        <p>Those are the two browsers I tested but if you want to roll the dice you could use something like Safari.</p>
        <p>Just again make sure it's in a proper browser window not on a phone.</p>
        <p><em>Is this going to be worth the effort?  Who knows.</em></p>
